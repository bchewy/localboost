# LocalBoost
a SMUChamps project

## Problem we’re solving:
Small local businesses have to browse through a myriad of information on the internet to achieve what they’re trying to do. Have no knowledge/skills or are digitally illiterate, and sometimes have no time to learn. 

- Overlord of Information
- No Knowledge or skills
- Resource Limitation
    
    Why are small local businesses not digitising? What services do they require?
