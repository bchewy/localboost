### Problem Statement:
Small local businesses often face hurdles in digitizing their operations due to overwhelming information, a lack of necessary digital skills, and resource constraints. Our goal is to understand why these businesses are not digitizing and what services they require to facilitate this transition.

### About LocalBoost:
LocalBoost is an online platform designed to assist small local businesses in overcoming digital obstacles. By connecting these businesses with skilled freelancers and students looking for real-world projects, we facilitate digital transformations through tailored solutions. 

Services provided by LocalBoost include:

- Digital stock counting solutions (e.g., setting up Excel, barcode systems)
- Website creation (using Wordpress, self-coded HTML, etc.)
- Setting up Google review websites and pre-booking services
- Implementing digital payment or POS systems

In doing so, LocalBoost aims to foster a community of digital enthusiasts and businesses working together to innovate and grow at the local level.

### Unique Selling Point:
LocalBoost focuses on aiding small local businesses such as hawkers, small restaurants, home-based businesses, and "mama shops." By empowering students and offering them the opportunity to work on these projects as case studies, we create a mutually beneficial situation.

### Technical Details:
LocalBoost is built with React and is deployed on Vercel for scalability.
The AI features seen on the site includes modified, exclusive access to GPT4 private request only API endpoint.

### Beyond the hackathon:
Beyond the hackathon, some of us would also like to explore
> Sandbox environment for students to play/work on eg: Deploying test instances via VMWare Tanzu to work on their applications.
> Add more suggestive and empowering features for users (eg: Simple PM tools, generative images for more.., accepting more auth logins, skillsfuture API usage... etc!)


Here's a brief overview of our project directories:

- `AI_prototype`: Our initial tests with OpenAI's GPT-4 API.
- `teleport_frontend`: Our planned frontend, elements of which can be seen in the final MVP.
- `main`: The root of our MVP from where the project is deployed live.

We hope this README provides a clear understanding of our project, LocalBoost, and its commitment to supporting small local businesses and digital enthusiasts.
